Freelancer App


## Description

It is a freelance application developed using React and Tailwind and has three roles: Admin, Freelancer and Owner. The login system uses a mobile phone number and an OTP code. Refresh Token and Access Token are used to authenticate each user. Verifying users is the responsibility of the Admin. This system works by defining the project by the Owner and defining the proposal for each project by the Freelancer and approving or rejecting them by the Owner.
